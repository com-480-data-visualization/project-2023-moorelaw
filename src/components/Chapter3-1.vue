    <h1>Period 1: Microarchitecture Improvement</h1>
    <p>(1971 to 2005)</p>

        <p class="pb-5">With the improvement of transistors, CPU designers have more transistors budget to design complex system to extract parallelism. Due to the small scope from hardware perspective, parallelism exploitation during this period are mainly from executing multiple instructions in parallel (a.k.a., instruction-level parallelism) and processing wider data chunk (a.k.a., data-level parallelism). </p>
        <p class="pb-1">Here are the main techniques for instruction-level parallelism: </p>
        <ul class="pb-5">
            <li>Pipelining</li>
            <li>Multi-issuing</li>
            <li>Our of Order (OoO) execution</li>
        </ul>
