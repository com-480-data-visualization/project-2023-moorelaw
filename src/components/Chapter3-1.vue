            CPU architects' goal in this period is utilize the transistors' budget to design structures to improve instruction execution speed.
            Optimization during this periods contributes to the performance from the following three aspects:

        <ul class="my-4">
            <li>Process more data per instruction. E.g., wider data and vector processing.</li>
            <li>Execute more instructions per clock cycle. E.g., pipelining, multi-issuing, and out-of-order execution.</li>
            <li>Shorter clock period. Both technology improvement and hardware design can influence this term.</li>
