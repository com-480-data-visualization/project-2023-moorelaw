    <h1>Stage 3: Specialization</h1>
    <p>(2015 to now)</p>

    <div class="text-justify mx-50">
        <p class="mt-10">Building specialized hardware to handle various tasks has become increasingly important in the field of computing. In the early days of computing, general-purpose CPUs were designed to handle a wide variety of tasks, but as the demand for specialized tasks grew, it became clear that CPUs alone were not sufficient. As a result, specialized hardware such as GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs have been developed to handle specific tasks, such as graphics processing, machine learning, and cryptocurrency mining, among others.</p>

        <p class="mt-10">General-purpose CPUs are not suitable for many specialized tasks due to their architecture, which is optimized for running a wide variety of applications. CPUs rely on a sequential execution model, which means that they execute instructions one at a time in a particular order. While this approach is suitable for general-purpose computing, it is not efficient for many specialized tasks, which often require the parallel processing of large amounts of data. Furthermore, CPUs have limited parallelism and are not optimized for specific data types and operations, which can lead to suboptimal performance for certain applications.</p>

        <p class="mt-10">Using specialized hardware such as GPUs is necessary to handle specialized tasks such as graphics processing, which requires the processing of large amounts of data in parallel. GPUs are optimized for parallel processing and can perform thousands of arithmetic and logic operations simultaneously. This makes GPUs well-suited for applications such as 3D graphics, scientific simulations, and machine learning, which require the processing of large datasets. Additionally, GPUs can perform specialized operations such as matrix multiplication and convolution efficiently, which are commonly used in deep learning and other machine learning applications. Therefore, using specialized hardware can provide significant performance benefits over general-purpose CPUs for specialized tasks.</p>
