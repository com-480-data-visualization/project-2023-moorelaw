    <h2>Stage 3: Specialization</h2>
    <p>(2015 to now)</p>

    <div class="text-justify mx-50 mt-10">
        <p class="mt-4">Building specialized hardware to handle various tasks has become increasingly important in the field of computing. In the early days of computing, general-purpose CPUs were designed to handle a wide variety of tasks, but as the demand for specialized tasks grew, it became clear that CPUs alone were not sufficient. As a result, specialized hardware have been developed to handle specific tasks, such as graphics processing, machine learning, and cryptocurrency mining, among others.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">General-purpose CPUs are not suitable for many specialized tasks due to their architecture, which is optimized for running a wide variety of applications. CPUs rely on a sequential execution model, which means that they execute instructions one at a time in a particular order. While this approach is suitable for general-purpose computing, it is not efficient for many specialized tasks, which often require the parallel processing of large amounts of data. Furthermore, CPUs have limited parallelism and are not optimized for specific data types and operations, which can lead to suboptimal performance for certain applications.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            As a result, architects start to build System-on-chip (<code class="font-bold">SoC</code>), which contains multiple specialized hardware to handle various tasks. Some of the typical hardware are graphics processing unit (GPU), neural processing unit (NPU), and security module.
