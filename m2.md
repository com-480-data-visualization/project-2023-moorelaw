# Project Goal
As mentioned in milestone 1, we'd like to introduce people to the development of microprocessors. The journey starts from the very beginning (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor), to one of the trending microprocessors (Apple M1). As a supplementry and visual aid to our story, some visualizations will be added, the sketches of which are included in the next section.  

# Sketches
## 1. Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)
### Goal
Showing how the charge carriers more inside the CMOS, and how the gate turns accordingly. 
### Effects
* When user clicks "Gate", the indicator would be lightened. Some charge carriers would appear in "p".
* Then, user can click "Source", the charge carriers would move to "Drain", new charge carriers would appear, and "Drain" would be lightened.
* Next, if the user click "Gate" again, it would be closed, all charge carriers would disappear. And if the user clicks on "source", all charge carriers would stop moving. In both cases, "Drain" would not be turned off. 
### Lectures and tools
* Lectures: Java Script part 1, More Java Script, Interactions, More interactive d3.js
* Tools: d3.js

## 2. NOT, AND, OR Gates
### Goal
Showing how the three kinds of gates work. User can learn the knowledge by interacting with the inputs, and check the outputs.
### Effects
* When the user presses the inputs (A, B), the outputs (Q, Y) would change accordingly. The open and close of the gates would also be indicated.
### Lectures and tools
* Lectures: Java Script part 1, More Java Script, Interactions, More interactive d3.js
* Tools: d3.js

## 3. Trend of CPU's delay, power, and area
### Goal
Give the user an overview of the trend of CPU's delay, power, and area. 
### Effects
* Show the line plots of all three trends. When the user hovers on the dots of the plot, the information of corresponding CPU would be given.
* When rendering the plots, the dots would be connected one by one. Giving the user a sense of change.
### Lectures and tools
* Lectures: D3.js, Interactions, More interactive d3.js
* Tools: d3.js

## 4. Evolution of processors' data width
### Goal
Using a tree graph, showing the evolution of CPU's data width. At first, the scalar and vector CPU develop separately. Then, new CPU that supports both scalar and vector appears.
### Effects
Drawing a tree graph, dynamically showing the trend of the development of CPU's data width.
### Lectures and tools
* Lectures: Java Script 1, 2
* 

## 5. Instruction processing phases
### Goal
Showing four different optimizations for processors, indicating their differences through a code example.
### Effects
* User can choose between different optimizations. A flow of the phases would start after an optimization is chosen. The currently executed insructions would be marked at each phase.   
### Lectures and tools
* Lectures: D3.js, Interactions, More interactive d3.js
* Tools: d3.js

## 6. CPU trend
### Goal
Showing the development trend of microprocessor during 50 years. Data included are CPU's frequency, number of logical cores, single-thread perfromance, number of transistors, and typical power. User can grasp an overview of how CPU has developped over the years, and the development patterns. The trending CPU each year would also be shown.
### Effects
* When the user hovers on the dots in the scatter plot, information of the corresponding CPU would be shown.
* When user clicks on the scatter plot, the information of trending CPU of the mouse's X coordination will appear. 
### Lectures and tools
* Lectures: D3.js, Interactions, More interactive d3.js
* Tools: d3.js

## 7. Skylake
### Goal
Dissecting the parts of a Skylake processor, showing the user the functionality of each parts of the CPU.
### Effects
* When the user hovers over an area in the die shot figure (figure on the right), the corresponding area in the architecture figure (figure on the left) would be lightened, vice versa.
* Information of the corresponding area would be shown when hovered on.
### Lectures and tools
* Lectures: D3.js, Interactions, More interactive d3.js
* Tools: d3.js

## 8. Data coherence
### Goal
Inform the user the two modes of maintaining data coherence (write-invalid mode and write-update mode). User can see how the change of data affects the workflow of CPU.
### Effects
* The data section in the table is editable. When the user changes the value, the core with changed data would send out message to other cores. In write-invalid mode, the message is an invalid flag indicating the data is changed. In write-update mode, the message is the new data. 
### Lectures and tools
* Lectures: D3.js, Interactions, More interactive d3.js
* Tools: d3.js

## 9. Core interconnection patterns
### Goal
Showing the user several interconnection patterns of cores'. User can learn about their properties, and understand why a pattern is applied according to the usage scenario.
### Effects
* The components of the figure would change and reform when user choose between different patterns, making the graph more smooth.
